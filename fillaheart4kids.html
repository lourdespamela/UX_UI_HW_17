            Executive Summary
          </h3>
          <p>
            The FillAHeart4Kids website contains outdated information that is
            organized in a disorienting and inefficient matter. It is not
            directly apparent what the organization’s mission is or what their
            projects entail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through 6 user interviews, my group members and I learned that in
            order for users to feel motivated to donate to an organization they
            want to know how their money will be used and feel a connection to
            the organization’s mission. The problem with the current design of
            the website is that the information is scattered throughout the
            website without an easy way to navigate around it to motivate users
            to want to donate or feel directly impacted by the organization’s
            website. As a result, FillaHeart4Kids is not receiving as many
            donations through their website as they are on their Facebook page.
          </p>
          <p>
            My group and I addressed these issues by redesigning the homepage
            and highlighting the organization's mission and various projects so
            that users have information they can connect with. We also revamped
            the navigation menu by renaming the menu's categories and
            rearranging the subpages. Lastly, we streamlined the donation
            process so that users have control over what they donate and know
            what their money will be used for.
          </p>

            User Interview Plan
          </h3>
          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Research Question</h6>
          <p>
            How might we improve the navigation and layout of the
            FillaHeart4Kids website in order to streamline the user’s process
            when donating to increase donation intakes for FillaHeart4Kids and
            motivate the users to want to donate?
          </p>
          <p>
            My group and I identified three objectives to collect information
            about when conducting our user interviews. Our first objective was
            to understand the user’s emotions that lead them to want to donate
            to donate and volunter. Our second objective was to learn about our
            user’s navigation habits and preferences. Our third objective was to
            gain insight about the user’s initial impressions of the
            FillaHeart4Kids website.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-header" id="user-insights">User Insights</h3>
          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Desire to Donate</h6>
          <p>
            We learned that users are motivated to donate to an organization
            when the process is simple and if they feel connected to the
            mission. We also learned that the current website does not meet
            these expectations for the users. See below for direct quotations
            from our user interviewees:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>“Donation feature is too hard to find”</li>
            <li>“The site could be more specific about its purpose”</li>
            <li>“Mission is not prominent on the page”</li>
            <li>“I want to learn more about how the money is put to use”</li>
            <li>“I like to feel connected to the cause before donating”</li>
            <li>“The donation process should be simple”</li>
            <li>“I want to learn more about how the money is put to use”</li>
          </ul>
          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">
            User Navigation Habits and Preferences
          </h6>
          <p>
            We also learned some of the navigation tools that people prefer to
            use or that they hope a website has and what some of our users think
            about FillaHeart4Kids’ navigation system:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>“Expects to be able to find information without struggling”</li>
            <li>“Prefers specific and apparent navigation tabs”</li>
            <li>“Thinks top menu bar is too small”</li>
            <li>“The purpose of some tabs/pages is unclear”</li>
            <li>“Looks for speed and clarity in navigation”</li>
            <li>“Drop-downs are helpful”</li>
            <li>“Good categorization/organization makes browsing easier”</li>
          </ul>
          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Usability Tests</h6>
          <p>
            During our user interviews we also conducted 5-second usability
            tests from our participants to learn what some of their thoughts
            about the website are. We observed for pain points with the website
            and what they like about the website:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>“Feels that there are too many different fonts”</li>
            <li>
              “Color scheme is fitting because hearts are usually pink and
              purple
            </li>
            <li>
              “Seems like the page is mostly event focused at first glance”
            </li>
            <li>“Too many fonts/does not feel cohesive”</li>
            <li>“It is not immediately apparent what the site is for”</li>
            <li>“Site is very bright and vibrant”</li>
          </ul>

              Problem Statement
          </h3>
          <p>
            FillAHeart4Kids is a nonprofit organization that provides resources such as clothing, school supplies, and meals for children who are homeless or in foster care. They also provide opportunities for individuals to donate and make a difference in the lives of children in the community. We have observed that FillAHeart4Kids has not been receiving many donations through their website. How might we improve the FillAHeart4kids website to help a teacher who has several students who are homeless or in foster care feel more confident about making a donation to their organization online?
